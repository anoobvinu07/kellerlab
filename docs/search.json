    "text": "Hybridization and Adaptive Introgression\nStatus: Ongoing | Publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we often think of species as being reproductively isolated from one another, this is not always the case. As a consequence of weak reproductive barriers, members of different species can interbreed in nature. When hybrids between two species are fertile, hybrids may then interbreed with members of the original species in a process known as backcrossing. Multiple generations of hybridization and subsequent backcrossing can facilitate the exchange of genetic material between parental species, a process known as introgression. Much of the research conducted in the Keller lab aims to understand if this exchange of genetic material is an adaptive process. For example, does genetic variation that increases tolerance to environmental stress in one species play the same role when it is introgressed into another species?\nOne current area of interest in the Keller lab is the susceptibility of hybrid poplars to infection by rust fungi in the genus Melampsora. One overarching question in the lab that this work addresses is the relationship between hybridization and local adaptation. The potential roles of ancestry and adaptation to local climatic variables as indicators of disease susceptibility in common garden experiments are being investigated.\n\n\n\nPoplar hybridization in the Pacific Northwest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoplar photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking through the poplar garden at Vermont\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoplar leaf miner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRusty poplars"

    "text": "Genomic Forecasting\nStatus: Ongoing | Publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecasting the responses of populations to climate change is a complex but important issue to understand as we face the potential for widespread climate maladaptation in the coming decades. This hits especially hard for long-lived, sessile organisms like forest trees, whose long-generation times and limited dispersal potential constrain the ability to adapt or track shifting climate. Recently, there has been increasing interest in combining genomics with climate models to forecast the short-term impacts of climate change on population adaptation. Our lab, in close collaboration with Matt Fitzaptrick’s lab has been developing computational approaches to predict near-term disruption of climate adaptation and predicted loss of local adaptation, known as “genomic offset” modelling.\nSince first introducing the concept and statistical framework for genomic offset (Fitzpatrick and Keller 2015), we have worked to refine and extend the scope and application of genomic offset models (Keller et al. 2017; Gougherty et al. 2018; Capblancq et al. 2020; Lachmuth et al. 2023; Eco Mon). We have also been working to address some of the sources of uncertainty using truth-known simulation testing of genomic offset predictions (Laruson et al. 2022), in collaboration with Katie Lotterhos’ lab, as well as testing the sensitivity various model choices such as the choice of genomic loci, the set of climate variables, and choice of future climate projection scenarios (Lachmuth et al. 2023, Frontiers).\nUltimately, the determination of whether offset models are any good will have to be done under natural settings using carefully designed validation tests with real populations. Our lab has been working on empirical testing of offset predictions, using a space-for-time approach that evaluates the effect of transferring genotypes from their source climate into one or more common garden sites, and predicting growth and fitness-traits from genomic offsets calculated between the source and garden site climates. Using poplar trees as a study system, we provided the first such common garden test of offset predictions, showing a strong negative response of growth with increasing genomic offset (Fitzpatrick et al. 2021). More recently, we’ve shown a similar result in red spruce (Picea rubens) across 3 seedling common gardens (Lachmuth et al. 2023; Eco Mon), as well as in a 60 year old red spruce provenance trial in northern New Hampshire (Verrico et al., in prep.).\n\n\n\nGenomic forecasting workflow."

In this pursuit, Keller lab has partnered with The Nature Conservancy, Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative (CASRI), …… UMCES folks.

This led to a larger partnership that culminated in genomic assisted seed source selection for the restoration initiative at these sites. Instead of opting for a single source restoration initiative, we used a multiple seed source approach to improve the genetic diversity of the restoration stands to withstand the changing climate and environmental stressors. This source selection was carried out in the light of research done by Keller lab using the exome capture data and the common gardens set up at Vermont, Maryland and North Carolina. Three to four sources combinations per restoration site were selected for high genetic diversity and low genetic load.\n\nCapblancq et al. (2021) has observed that early-life fitness of the red spruce had strong positive association with genetic diversity and negative association with genetic load, especially for the southern range edge of the red spruce distribution range. These seed source combinations were used as a recommendation list to Dave Seville (CASRI) to assess the seed production situation on the ground and raise them in the nursery for the restoration initiative. In 2021, TNC planted 58,000 red spruce seedlings at the restoration sites. Keller lab then carried out the restoration monitoring of these restoration sites in 2022, a whole year after the seedlings had been planted in the ground to assess the success of genomic assisted restoration of red spruce. Using this information, Prakash et al. (in prep) found that there were no “Super Seed Source” that outperformed other seed sources and the combination of seed sources outperformed any single source for the restoration success.\n\n\n\nGenomic assisted red spruce restoration at Maryland, West-Viginia and Virginia, USA."

    "text": "Invasions\nStatus: Completed\nThe movement of species into new habitats allows populations that were previously geographically isolated to reproduce with each other and create novel genotypes through hybridization. Through environmental selection, novel genotypes can result in phenotypes that increase hybrid fitness and promote biological invasions. Furthermore, hybridization between genetically distinct species can result in changes to the genome size or species ploidy, which can alter the reproduction rate and promote invasion success. The rapid evolution of hybrid species in the introduced range can lead to a drastic shift in the stable state dynamics of the ecosystem, transforming the community assembly.\nPast research has largely focused on the effects of hybridization in Centaura × moncktonii (C. jacea × C. nigra), a plant invasive to North America known as Japanese knapweed. Using a combination of field collections at hybrid zones in eastern North America and the Pacific northwest.\nAn assessment of the genome size, degree of introgression, and species traits reveals that hybrid individuals have smaller genomes and capitula traits that promote reproductive success, indicating that admixture of C. jacea and C. nigra can generate invasive genotypes that are environmentally selected for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking through the poplar garden at Vermont\nPoplar leaf miner\nRusty poplars\nGenomic assisted red spruce restoration at Maryland, West-Viginia and Virginia, USA."

    "text": "Dr. Stephen Keller\nAssociate Professor |  |  |  | \n\n\n\n\n\nSteve got his B.S. from Juniata College in Pennsylvania before working as a biologist for the National Park Service in Colorado. From there, he ventured northward to do a master’s in biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks with Kent Schwaegerle, where he studied breeding system evolution in arctic-alpine plants. Steve got his Ph.D. at the University of Virginia with Doug Taylor on the population genetics of invasive species, followed by postdoc research at the University of Minnesota in Peter Tiffin’s lab working on population genomics in Populus. After three years (2011-2014) on the faculty at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, Steve joined the Department of Plant Biology at the University of Vermont.\n\n\n\nNora Heaphy\nPh.D. Student | \n\n\n\n\n\nNora is interested in how plant live in stressful environments (especially in the Middle East and North Africa), if and how they will adapt to climate change, and how genetic factors interact with the environment to shape evolutionary trajectories. She completed her B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale, then worked as a research assistant in Erika Edwards’ lab, studying climate niche differentiation and convergent evolution in Portulaca and Viburnum. Before joining the Keller lab in 2023, she lived in Egypt and studied Arabic at the American University in Cairo.\n\n\n\nAnoob Prakash\nPh.D. Student |  |  | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnoob is interested in understanding the genomics and adaptation of fragmented ecosystem to rapid climate warming. For his PhD research, Anoob is investigating range wide variation and climate change adaptation in red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg). Specifically, he utilizes population genomic and quantitative genetic approaches to understand the long- and short-term responses of long-lived tree species like red spruce to climate change and pave the way for scientifically guided conservation efforts. As part of bridging the gap between science and restoration, he did restoration monitoring of red spruce with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) as part of his NSF-funded UVM QuEST internship. Before joining Keller lab in 2018, he completed his B.Sc. (Hons.) and M.Sc. in Forestry with specialization in Tree Physiology and Breeding at Kerala Agricultural University. During that time, he investigated the effects of particulate pollution on the growth and physiology of trees in moist deciduous forests.\n\n\n\nBaxter Worthing\nPh.D. Student | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaxter uses genetics and genomics to study two species of poplar tree: balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) and black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). The goal of his research is to identify and untangle the genetic and environmental factors that influence adaptively important traits such as phenology and freezing tolerance, and to predict how these traits may respond to changing climates. Furthermore, P. balsamifera and P. trichocarpa hybridize in nature, a process that facilitates the transfer of genetic variation between species and that likely underlies adaptive phenotypic variation. To account for the geographic and genetic diversity, Baxter conducts his research using hundreds trees sampled from the wild and clonally propagated in common gardens at UVM and other locations across the country. He is combining observations of these trees with rich environmental and genetic data in order to better understand the complex interactions between genomics and ecology.\n\n\n\nAngelica Golbin\nUndergraduate Student | \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngelica is an Environmental Sciences major and Molecular Genetics minor who joined the lab in 2021.She was awarded the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in 2022, where she investigated how hybridization can transfer useful genes in poplars to generate offspring that show hybrid vigor under heat and drought stress.

    "text": "Welcome to the Keller Lab!\nWe study the interaction between genomic variation in natural populations and environmental change. Human impacts on the environment, such as climate change and biological invasions, can abruptly alter both the genetic and ecological context within which species evolve. We seek to characterize the effects of these events on the diversity and evolutionary potential within species, as well as their consequences for conservation and resource management. Our primary focus is on the genetics of forest trees and invasive plants, but we also work on other study systems with collaborators.\nMany of our questions require a multidisciplinary approach, and thus the tools we use to address them are broad. We make use of modern genomic and computational approaches to examine molecular variation in the genome and the evolutionary history of populations. We also apply traditional techniques from quantitative genetics and ecological field experiments to measure the strength of natural selection and the functional divergence of populations. Finally, since many of our questions involve an explicitly spatial context, we use modeling for the analysis of environmental relationships.\n\n\nAdaptation! Resilience! Diversity!\nOur lab believes diversity is a key feature of both human and natural systems that are adaptable, resilient, and productive. In our research, teaching, and mentoring, we embrace people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and experiences as we collaborate together on our shared goals. We also acknowledge the centuries-long exclusion of people of color, especially Black and Indigenous people, from the natural sciences, as well as of other groups underrepresented in the field. We work to create an anti-racist environment that includes and amplifies diverse viewpoints and perspectives, values our differences, and cultivates leadership at all levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews!\n\n\n\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS IN AM. NAT. FOR A SPECIAL FEATURE ON GENOMIC FORECASTING\nWe’re excited to announce a call for papers on the topic of genomic forecasting of climate (mal)adaptation, organized as a Special Feature in the American Naturalist!. Katie Lotterhos, Matt Fitzpatrick, and Steve will be serving as Editors for the issue. Deadline for submissions is Oct 01, 2024!\n\n\n\nCONFERENCE NEWS\nCongrats to Nora for winning best poster at the 2023 Forest Ecosystem Monitoring Conference! She presented on her rotation work using genomic offset modeling to identify potential donor red spruce trees for collecting scions (branches used in grafting) to be used for establishing a climate-smart seed orchard.\nAnoob and Steve are headed to Stockholm to present at the IUFRO 2024 World Congress! in June. It will be part of a symposium Steve is helping to organize, titled “The impact of introgressive hybridization on adaptive capacity of forest trees in the Anthropocene.”\nLastly, stay tuned for an annoucement for an upcoming symposium on predicitng rapid evolution to climate change at the 3rd Joint Congress on Evolutionary Biology! in Montreal\n\n\n\nNEW LAB MEMBERS\nThe lab is excited to welcome new members – PhD student and recipient of a NSF-GRFP fellowship, Nora Heaphy, and post-bacc researcher and recipient of a DOE-ORISE fellowship, Rei Jia. A big welcome to the Keller Lab!\n\n\n\nNEW PROJECT\nSteve got funded by the National Science Foundation Biodiversity on a Changing Planet program!
